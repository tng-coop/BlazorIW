# Codex Instructions

This repository is primarily a .NET Blazor project. The `package.json` in the repository exists only for Playwright-driven browser tests. Those tests are currently not used, so the Node tooling is effectively dormant. Unless Playwright testing becomes relevant, you can ignore `npm` and `package.json`.
